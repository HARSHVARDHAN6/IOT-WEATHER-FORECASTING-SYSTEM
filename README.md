# IOT-WEATHER-FORECASTING-SYSTEM

A weather station can be described as an instrument or device, which provides us with the information of the weather in our neighboring environment. 
The goalof this project is to find details about the surrounding temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, etc. Internet of Things (IOT) takes this a step further and
connects not only humans but electronic devices which can speak amongst themselves. Hence, this device basically senses the temperature, pressure, humidity, light intensity. There are various types of sensors present in the
prototype, using which all the aforementioned parameters can be measured. It can be used to monitor the temperature or humidity of a particular room/place. With the help of temperature and humidity we can calculate other data
parameters, such as the dew point. In addition to the above mentioned functionalities, we can monitor the light intensity of the place as well.
We have also enabled to monitor the atmospheric pressure of the room. We can also monitor the rain value. Four sensors are connected to the Node MCU namely temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), pressure sensor (BMP180), raindrop
module, and light dependent resistor (LDR). In the cloud service one can utilize these data to alert people by various means such as using a buzzer or sending them an e-mail or sending them SMS etc.
